Build tclsyslogd from the src directory.

Make install doesn't currently work from there as this stuff isn't in
the FreeBSD source tree.

Copy tclsyslogd script to /usr/local/etc/rc.d

Copy tclsyslogd binary from ../src to /usr/local/sbin

Edit /etc/rc.conf to enable tclsyslogd and disable syslogd...

tclsyslogd_enable="YES"
syslogd_enable="NO"

Copy syslogd_flags as tclsyslogd_flags, for instance for a log host:

tclsyslogd_flags=""
